# Hi there 👋

[Creative Scala's](https://creativescala.org/) goal is to make Scala fun. 
We do this by creating training material that introduces Scala through non-traditional means, 
and libraries that unleash digital creativity.

Our main projects are:

* [Doodle](https://creativescala.org/doodle), a library for compositional two dimensional vector graphics. 
It has applications for data visualization and creative coding.

* [Creative Scala](https://creativescala.org/creative-scala), an introduction to programming and Scala, 
aimed at students without a STEM background. 

See our other repositories for other things we do,
and check out our [Github projects](https://github.com/creativescala/.github/projects) for work in progress.

👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
